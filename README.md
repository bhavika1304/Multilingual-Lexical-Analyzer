# Multilingual-Lexical-Analyzer

# Overview
This project implements a lexical analyzer that supports multiple programming languages including Java, C, and C++. The analyzer reads code from a file, tokenizes it, and classifies each token as keywords, operators, identifiers, numbers, symbols, or strings.

# Features
  - Supports Java, C, and C++.
  - Tokenizes the input code into tokens.
  - Generates a token table using the tabulate library.

# Installation
https://github.com/bhavika1304/Multilingual-Lexical-Analyzer.git

# Prerequisites
  - Python 3.x
  - Install tabulate:
    pip install tabulate

# Usage
  - Run the script:
    python multilingual_lexical_analyzer.py
  - Input the path to a C/C++/Java code file when prompted.
  - The script will detect the programming language, tokenize the code, and display the tokens in a tabulated format.
